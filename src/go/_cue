# cue evaluates CUE files, an extension of JSON, and sends them
# to user-defined commands for processing.
#
# Commands are defined in CUE as follows:
#
# 	command deploy: {
# 		cmd:   "kubectl"
# 		args:  [ "-f", "deploy" ]
# 		in:    json.Encode($) // encode the emitted configuration.
# 	}
#
# cue can also combine the results of http or grpc request with the input
# configuration for further processing. For more information on defining commands
# run 'cue help cmd' or go to cuelang.org/pkg/cmd.
#
# For more information on writing CUE configuration files see cuelang.org.

# export evaluates the configuration found in the current
# directory and prints the emit value to stdout.
#
# Examples:
# Evaluated and emit
#
# 	# a single file
# 	cue export config.cue
#
# 	# multiple files: these are combined at the top-level. Order doesn't matter.
# 	cue export file1.cue foo/file2.cue
#
# 	# all files within the "mypkg" package: this includes all files in the
# 	# current directory and its ancestor directories that are marked with the
# 	# same package.
# 	cue export -p cloud
#
# 	# the -p flag can be omitted if the directory only contains files for
# 	# the "mypkg" package.
# 	cue export
#
# Emit value:
# For CUE files, the generated configuration is derived from the top-level
# single expression, the emit value. For example, the file
#
# 	// config.cue
# 	arg1: 1
# 	arg2: "my string"
#
# 	{
# 		a: arg1
# 		b: arg2
# 	}
#
# yields the following JSON:
#
# 	{
# 		"a": 1,
# 		"b", "my string"
# 	}
#
# In absence of arguments, the current directory is loaded as a package instance.
# A package instance for a directory contains all files in the directory and its
# ancestor directories, up to the module root, belonging to the same package.
# If the package is not explicitly defined by the '-p' flag, it must be uniquely
# defined by the files in the current directory.

#
# go converts Go types into CUE definitions
#
# The command "cue get go" is like "go get", but converts the retrieved Go
# packages to CUE. The retrieved packages are put in the CUE module's pkg
# directory at the import path of the corresponding Go package. The converted
# definitions are available to any CUE file within the CUE module by using
# this import path.
#
# The Go type definitions are converted to CUE based on how they would be
# interpreted by Go's encoding/json package. Definitions for a Go file foo.go
# are written to a CUE file named foo_go_gen.cue.
#
# It is safe for users to add additional files to the generated directories,
# as long as their name does not end with _gen.*.
#
#
# Rules of Converting Go types to CUE
#
# Go structs are converted to cue structs adhering to the following conventions:
#
# 	- field names are translated based on the definition of a "json" or "yaml"
# 	  tag, in that order.
#
# 	- embedded structs marked with a json inline tag unify with struct
# 	  definition. For instance, the Go struct
#
# 	    struct MyStruct {
# 			Common  json:",inline"
# 			Field string
# 		 }
#
# 	  translates to the CUE struct
#
# 		 MyStruct: Common & {
# 			 Field: string
# 		 }
#
# 	- a type that implements MarshalJSON, UnmarshalJSON, MarshalYAML, or
# 	  UnmarshalYAML is translated to top (_) to indicate it may be any
# 	  value. For some Go core types for which the implementation of these
# 	  methods is known, like time.Time, the type may be more specific.
#
# 	- a type implementing MarshalText or UnmarshalText is represented as
# 	  the CUE type string
#
# 	- slices and arrays convert to CUE lists, except when the element type is
# 	  byte, in which case it translates to the CUE bytes type.
# 	  In the case of arrays, the length of the CUE value is constrained
# 	  accordingly, when possible.
#
# 	- Maps translate to a CUE struct, where all elements are constrained to
# 	  be of Go map element type. Like for JSON, maps may only have string keys.
#
# 	- Pointers translate to a sum type with the default value of null and
# 	  the Go type as an alternative value.
#
# 	- Field tags are translated to CUE's field attributes. In some cases,
# 	  the contents are rewritten to reflect the corresponding types in CUE.
# 	  The @go attribute is added if the field name or type definition differs
# 	  between the generated CUE and the original Go.
#
#
# Native CUE Constraints
#
# Native CUE constraints may be defined in separate cue files alongside the
# generated files either in the original Go directory or in the generated
# directory. These files can impose additional constraints on types and values
# that are not otherwise expressible in Go. The package name for these CUE files
# must be the same as that of the Go package.
#
# For instance, for the type
#
# 	package foo
#
#     type IP4String string
#
# defined in the Go package, one could add a cue file foo.cue with the following
# contents to allow IP4String to assume only valid IP4 addresses:
#
# 	package foo
#
# 	// IP4String defines a valid IP4 address.
# 	IP4String: =~#"^\#(byte)\.\#(byte)\.\#(byte)\.\#(byte)$"#
#
# 	// byte defines string allowing integer values of 0-255.
# 	byte = #"([01]?\d?\d|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])"#
#
#
# The "cue get go" command copies any cue files in the original Go package
# directory that has a package clause with the same name as the Go package to the
# destination directory, replacing its .cue ending with _gen.cue.
#
# Alternatively, the additional native constraints can be added to the generated
# package, as long as the file name does not end with _gen.cue.
# Running cue get go again to regenerate the package will never overwrite any
# files not ending with _gen.*.
#
#
# Constants and Enums
#
# Go does not have an enum or sum type. Conventionally, a type that is supposed
# to be an enum is followed by a const block with the allowed values for that
# type. However, as that is only a guideline and not a hard rule, these cases
# cannot be translated to CUE disjunctions automatically.
#
# Constant values, however, are generated in a way that makes it easy to convert
# a type to a proper enum using native CUE constraints. For instance, the Go type
#
# 	package foo
#
# 	type Switch int
#
# 	const (
# 		Off Switch = iota
# 		On
# 	)
#
# translates into the following CUE definitions:
#
# 	package foo
#
# 	Switch: int // enumSwitch
#
# 	enumSwitch: Off | On
#
# 	Off: 0
# 	On:  1
#
# This definition allows any integer value for Switch, while the enumSwitch value
# defines all defined constants for Switch and thus all valid values if Switch
# were to be interpreted as an enum type. To turn Switch into an enum,
# include the following constraint in, say, enum.cue, in either the original
# source directory or the generated directory:
#
# 	package foo
#
# 	// limit the valid values for Switch to those existing as constants with
# 	// the same type.
# 	Switch: enumSwitch
#
# This tells CUE that only the values enumerated by enumSwitch are valid
# values for Switch. Note that there are now two definitions of Switch.
# CUE handles this in the usual way by unifying the two definitions, in which case
# the more restrictive enum interpretation of Switch remains.
#

#   -e, --exclude string   comma-separated list of regexps of entries
#   -h, --help             help for go

#
# terminating because of errors
# import converts other data formats, like JSON and YAML to CUE files
#
# The following file formats are currently supported:
#
#   Format       Extensions
# 	JSON       .json .jsonl .ndjson
# 	YAML       .yaml .yml
# 	protobuf   .proto
#
# Files can either be specified explicitly, or inferred from the specified
# packages. In either case, the file extension is replaced with .cue. It will
# fail if the file already exists by default. The -f flag overrides this.
#
# Examples:
#
#   # Convert individual files:
#   $ cue import foo.json bar.json  # create foo.yaml and bar.yaml
#
#   # Convert all json files in the indicated directories:
#   $ cue import ./... -type=json
#
#
# The -path flag
#
# By default the parsed files are included as emit values. This default can be
# overridden by specifying a sequence of labels as you would in a CUE file.
# An identifier or string label are interpreted as usual. A label expression is
# evaluated within the context of the imported file. label expressions may also
# refer to builtin packages, which will be implicitly imported.
#
#
# Handling multiple documents or streams
#
# To handle Multi-document files, such as concatenated JSON objects or
# YAML files with document separators (---) the user must specify either the
# -path, -list, or -files flag. The -path flag assign each element to a path
# (identical paths are treated as usual); -list concatenates the entries, and
# -files causes each entry to be written to a different file. The -files flag
# may only be used if files are explicitly imported. The -list flag may be
# used in combination with the -path flag, concatenating each entry to the
# mapped location.
#
#
# Examples:
#
#   $ cat <<EOF > foo.yaml
#   kind: Service
#   name: booster
#   EOF
#
#   # include the parsed file as an emit value:
#   $ cue import foo.yaml
#   $ cat foo.cue
#   {
#       kind: Service
#       name: booster
#   }
#
#   # include the parsed file at the root of the CUE file:
#   $ cue import -f -l "" foo.yaml
#   $ cat foo.cue
#   kind: Service
#   name: booster
#
#   # include the import config at the mystuff path
#   $ cue import -f -l mystuff foo.yaml
#   $ cat foo.cue
#   myStuff: {
#       kind: Service
#       name: booster

#
#
# Embedded data files
#
# The --recursive or -R flag enables the parsing of fields that are string
# representations of data formats themselves. A field that can be parsed is
# replaced with a call encoding the data from a structured form that is placed
# in a sibling field.
#
# It is also possible to recursively hoist data formats:
#
# Example:
#   $ cat <<EOF > example.json
#   "a": {
#       "data": '{ "foo": 1, "bar": 2 }',
#   }
#   EOF
#
#   $ cue import -R example.json
#   $ cat example.cue
#   import "encode/json"
#
#   a: {
#       data: json.Encode(_data),

# trim removes fields from structs that are already defined by a template
#
# A field, struct, or list is removed if it is implied by a template, a list type
# value, a comprehension or any other implied content. It will modify the files
# in place.
#
# Limitations
# Removal is on a best effort basis. Some caveats:
# - Fields in implied content may refer to fields within the struct in which
#   they are included, but are only resolved on a best-effort basis.
# - Disjunctions that contain structs in implied content cannot be used to
#   remove fields.
# - There is currently no verification step: manual verification is required.
#
# Examples:
#
# 	$ cat <<EOF > foo.cue
# 	light <Name>: {
# 		room:          string
# 		brightnessOff: 0.0 | >=0 & <=100.0

#
# vet validates CUE and other data files
#
# By default it will only validate if there are no errors.
# The -c validates that all regular fields are concrete.
#
#
# Checking non-CUE files
#
# Vet can also check non-CUE files. The following file formats are
# currently supported:
#
#   Format       Extensions
# 	JSON       .json .jsonl .ndjson
# 	YAML       .yaml .yml
#
# To activate this mode, the non-cue files must be explicitly mentioned on the
# command line. There must also be at least one CUE file to hold the constraints.
#
# In this mode, each file will be verified against a CUE constraint. If the files
# contain multiple objects (such as using --- in YAML), they will all be verified
# individually.
#
# By default, each file is checked against the root of the loaded CUE files.
# The -e can be used to only verify files against the result of an expression
# evaluated within the CUE files. This can be useful if the CUE files contain
# a set of definitions to pick from.
#
# Examples:
#
#   # Check files against a CUE file:
#   cue vet foo.yaml foo.cue
#
#   # Check files against a particular expression
#   cue vet translations/*.yaml foo.cue -e Translation
#
# If more than one expression is given, all must match all values.
#
# Usage:
#   cue vet [flags]
#
# Flags:
#   -c, --concrete                 require the evaluation to be concrete
#   -e, --expression stringArray   use this expression to validate non-CUE files
#   -h, --help                     help for vet
#
# Global Flags:
#       --debug            give detailed error info
#   -i, --ignore           proceed in the presence of errors
#   -p, --package string   CUE package to evaluate
#   -s, --simplify         simplify output
#       --trace            trace computation
#   -v, --verbose          print information about progress
